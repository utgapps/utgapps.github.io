# Builds printable step-by-step workbooks for ALL arcade games, plus the assembled
# playable game for each (to verify the steps really make a working game), plus an
# index page linking them. Run: python workbooks.py

# Structure (real PixelPad rooms):
#   Game        - holds globals (score, lives); start() sets them and set_room('Play')
#   Play room   - creates the objects + the HUD; the game is played here
#   GameOver    - a separate room shown when you lose; tap goes back to Play
# Rules: each step edits ONE tab, adds a few NEW lines (green), playable often,
#        named variables, no arrays, white text (.color = "white").

# 21) DRIFT RUSH - top-down car drifting.
#  The car's NOSE is a little arrow (noseX, noseY). Pressing Up pushes the car
#  the way the nose points. The car also has its own speed (speedX, speedY) that
#  keeps its momentum, so when you turn hard the car keeps sliding the old way
#  while the nose points the new way = a drift. "Grip" pulls the slide back
#  toward the nose; the handbrake (Space) drops the grip so you slide more.
#  Kept to + - * and < > only: the nose is turned with a tiny area-preserving
#  spin (the 0.07), and the sideways slide is found with a dot product.
